		<h3 align="left">Welcome to R Web site!</h3>
		<center>
		<p align="left">This is a little autobiography about our Dad, Art 
		Cabico.</p>
		<p align="justify">My name is Jacinto Arthur Cabico and the following is a 
		short autobiography I wrote for NMDP at the beginning of my journey to 
		find a cure.</p>
		</center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">My father came to the United States 
		from the Philippines in the early 1920’s. His first stop was the 
		Hawaiian Islands where he worked as a farm hand. There, he raised money 
		for his brothers and cousins to immigrate from the Philippines. When 
		America joined the second world war, he joined the U.S. Navy and served 
		until the end of the war. He earned his citizenship by fighting in the 
		war and was in Hawaii when Hawaii was awarded statehood. My father met 
		my mother in the Philippines in 1962. He was visiting for his brother’s 
		wedding. She was the sister of his brother’s new wife. They were then 
		married in 1963 which as the story goes, two brothers married two 
		sisters. My father was 59 and my mother was 24 when they wed. I was born 
		in 1964 and grew up in California’s famed San Fernando Valley. I was 
		born Jacinto Arthur Cabico. Of course, for my entire life no one could 
		pronounce my first name correctly (let alone my last name) so everyone 
		has known me by my middle name - Art. For half my childhood two families 
		lived together under the same roof – my Uncle, Aunt, two cousins, mom, 
		dad, and myself. A couple of years later, my mother’s parents came to 
		live with us also.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">So I grew up and spent my formative 
		and high school years in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s in Southern 
		California. I was happy in 1982 to be accepted to the University of 
		Notre Dame’s Undergraduate program where I spent 4 years in Indiana. 
		After graduating in 1986, I returned to Southern California where I 
		worked in the medical field for a number years as a manager in a large 
		Diagnostic Imaging firm. In 1987, I entered my first marriage and in 
		1989 my daughter, Ashley, was born in Torrance, CA. </p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In 1992, I was employed at 
		Cedars-Sinai Medical Center as a research associate in Nuclear Medicine 
		Imaging. This year also saw the end of my first marriage which saw many 
		struggles, but I still maintained active part of Ashley’s life. While at 
		CSMC, I met and fell in love with Robin. We were married in April of 
		1994 and similarly to my parents, our daughter, Katelyn, was born a 
		little over 1 year later. Katelyn’s delivery and birth was met with many 
		struggles. Her birth occurred two weeks after her due date and was an 
		induced delivery which then turned into an emergency c-section procedure 
		because of fetal distress. After her entry into the world, which is 
		supposed to be one of the most joyous times in a parent’s life, I was 
		approached by the obstetrics doctor who informed me that Robin had lost 
		almost all of her blood on the operating table and all life-saving 
		procedures at their disposal had been attempted ending with a radical 
		hysterectomy. I was told to inform all of our immediate family members 
		to come to the hospital because Robin would not make it through the 
		night. But Robin is a fighter and did not give up and after two weeks in 
		Intensive Care, surprised everyone by using every ounce of strength to 
		combat renal failure and liver failure. She was discharged from the 
		hospital after three weeks.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Needless to say, after such a life 
		changing event, we made the decision together to leave Southern 
		California and move to Phoenix, Arizona to be near Robin’s family. In 
		late 1995, we said goodbye to the west coast and moved to the desert. We 
		made our home in Mesa, Arizona. In the beginning, we attempted to have 
		more children by employing surrogacy. After multiple treatments and the 
		complete exhaustion of our retirement funds, we were unable to have more 
		children. The stress and challenges of such an ordeal tend to test a 
		marriage and a family’s ability to sustain itself in adversity. But by 
		the grace of God and our faith we endured and I believe developed an 
		even stronger bond. </p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In the late 1990’s, we decided that 
		God’s plan for was of a greater purpose and that we really were not 
		meant to have more biological children. Instead, we were to help 
		children as foster parents and so we took an active role and became 
		certified to foster special needs children through an agency called Aid 
		to Adoption of Special-needs Kids. We saw many children come through our 
		home as we provided a place for these kids to stay and our daughter 
		learned many lessons in life through this special service. Many of these 
		children we would have adopted in a heartbeat but with all of our 
		advocacy and good intentions, they were never permanently placed with 
		us.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">After a while, one begins to doubt 
		our purpose in His eyes and as children came and went through our home, 
		we became discouraged. It was near the end of our foster care license 
		that we decided it was just not meant to be and we would not be adopting 
		more children. We gave up the intense fight and decided to leave the 
		path we had chosen in His hands. We were called by the agency that a 
		woman was looking for a family to adopt her unborn daughter and had come 
		to the agency for assistance. We were told that twenty other families 
		were placed in front of this mother but that if we liked, our family 
		would be added to the list of potential adoptive families. All the odds 
		were against us being picked but we decided to put our faith to the test 
		and leave it in God’s hands. Our family was chosen and two weeks later, 
		we received the call that we had a new daughter, Mackenzie, to add to 
		our family. We had increased our family by one precious little child. We 
		decided to renew our foster care license and for the next two years 
		continued to take in special needs children through our home.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In January of 2003, we were called 
		by the agency and asked if we could take two premature baby boys who 
		needed a home immediately. We were told that they tested positive for 
		various controlled substances which was the cause for their 10 week 
		premature birth. They came into this world at just over 2 pounds and 
		came into our lives at about 4 pounds each. They had numerous challenges 
		and the state provided such services as Early Intervention therapy, 
		physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy just to name 
		a few. The beginning of their lives consisted of a variety of many 
		doctors’ visits throughout the week and Robin juggling a 6-year-old, an 
		18-month-old and now twin boys. The agency informed us from the 
		beginning that this was a temporary placement in our home just as all 
		the others and that a permanent home would be found for the twins in 6-8 
		weeks.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In August of 2007, we adopted the 
		twins who were then 4-and-a-half years old. Our family had exploded to 5 
		children in all. Our family had been through many struggles and 
		admittedly many challenges that have arisen due to the nature raising 
		these special needs twins. But they are our sons, and because of my 
		family’s history of longevity, we believe that our family is the best 
		place for these children and that we would fight to keep them all 
		because they were members of&nbsp; “Our Family.”</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Life changes in the blink of an eye 
		as they say and in January of 2008, as the result of a physical exam 
		needed to renew our foster care license, fluid was discovered in my 
		lungs. At first, because of my Filipino background, Valley Fever had to 
		be ruled out. After ruling this out, the only thing left was some sort 
		of lymphoma. Almost weekly, I had to go in and have 2 liters (about the 
		size of a large soda bottle) of fluid were removed from my lungs. I also 
		had a barrage of tests performed and they all pointed to cancer. After a 
		last set of outpatient scans, it was decided that I needed a surgeon to 
		biopsy the lymph node in my abdomen to get a definitive diagnosis. We 
		felt that time was running out but we were at a loss as to how to 
		expedite the process. Over the weekend I developed severe pain in back 
		which I attributed to a kidney stone that was seen on a previous scan. 
		We went to the emergency department where they diagnosed me as having 
		passed a kidney stone but cancer of the urinary system could not be 
		ruled out. I was sent home with pain medication and orders to follow up 
		with my doctor on Monday. However, Sunday morning arrived and so did the 
		intense pain once again in my back. After the church service, it was 
		unbearable and so after speaking the on-call doctor, we decided to go to 
		the hospital and request to be admitted.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Following an 8 hour ordeal in the 
		emergency room, I was finally admitted with a diagnosis of renal 
		failure. My kidneys were shutting down and we did not know the reason. 
		From the start of this process, Robin has been my strength and my 
		biggest advocate. Without her, I would have succumbed to depression from 
		the shear stress of what I am undergoing. She pushed the doctors to find 
		a resolution to my illness and come to a final diagnosis that we could 
		work with. After a final diagnosis of Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s follicular 
		lymphoma, I began chemotherapy in the hospital. I have been through 11 
		rounds so far. The last hurdle involved the growth of the cancer into my 
		right hip and the new involvement of bone. </p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This brings us to today. The 
		doctors tell me that because the pain and the appearance of cancer cells 
		in my right hip, the type of cancer is likely aggressive and not the 
		slow-growing type we had originally thought. And although the lymph 
		nodes throughout my body appear to be responding to the chemotherapy, 
		the biopsy of the bone in my right hip indicates a more aggressive 
		lymphoma. I have seen a specialist in bone marrow transplants located in 
		Phoenix and it is her opinion based on years of experience that my best 
		chance to beat this disease is to have a bone marrow transplant from a 
		donor. After delays in going forward, we decided to transfer care to MD 
		Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. U.S. News and World Report has 
		ranked this hospital number one in the nation for treating cancer. We 
		are currently on the highest chemotherapy that they can put my body 
		through in an attempt to get the cancer into remission. As we stated 
		earlier, the only way to cure this disease is for me to have a bone 
		marrow transplant from an unrelated donor. We have already tested the 
		closest possible related donors but unfortunately, they do not match on 
		enough significant markers.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Quite an interesting twist of 
		events. In 1996, while working at Good Samaritan Medical Center in 
		Phoenix, I registered as a bone marrow donor with the National Bone 
		Marrow Donor program. After reading the literature and statistics, I was 
		astounded to find that of the more than 7 million adult registered 
		donors, only 9000 of them fall under the Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 
		category. To put that into greater perspective, that’s one tenth of one 
		percent. Here is my analogy – Let’s say your employer pays you $100 an 
		hour but you were taxed on that money and your take-home pay was 10 cents 
		per hour. How many hours would you have to work to make a living? So I 
		registered knowing that my donation could make a difference and save 
		someone’s life. Now 12 years later, I find myself on the other side of 
		the coin – looking for someone who can save mine. Because statistically, 
		the best match in bone marrow donation would be someone who is Filipino 
		but if you look at the percentages of Pacific Islanders on the registry, 
		my odds are not very good. So to tip the scales in my favor, I am going 
		to do whatever I can to help educate the many Pacific Islanders 
		(Filipinos in particular) out there that they can make a difference by 
		registering as a bone marrow donor. And by doing so, we can change the 
		statistics and save many more lives.</p>
		<center>
		<center>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Well-renowned professor at Carnegie 
		Mellon University and author of the book, <u>The Last Lecture</u>, Randy Pausch said, “We 
		cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.” This is my 
		approach to life as it now involves cancer. There is no one to blame and 
		certainly not God.&nbsp; Is it unfair that I have cancer? No – 
		cancer does not choose from economic, political or financial 
		demographics. It is simply just unlucky - just like the hand you are 
		dealt in poker. But even a bad hand in poker can win if one just plays 
		the cards right.</p>
